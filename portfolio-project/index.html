				<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
				<div class="half-width">
				<p> Hello, I am a 6’6” Husband and Father of four, Firefighter, Mechanic, Builder, Woodworker, and God loving follower of Jesus Christ.
				I was born in southern Indiana, lived and graduated from the same small town. Once graduated, I went to Louisville for Tech school to get certified in 
				Marine Mechanics. Moved to the Indianapolis area to begin my career and spent eight great years there. 
				</p>
				</div>
				<div class="half-width">
				<p>In that eight years, I got married to my best
				friend and started a family. After that I began my career change to become a Firefighter which is what I am currently doing. It has been ten years
				working in this profession and I am beginning to realize my body may not take the beating for another 12 years. Thus bringing me to website development,
				which is what I consider as being a keyboard mechanic.</p>

					<h3>Who am I?</h3>
					<p>I’m a fix-it guy. I have an uncanny ability to fix things. When a problem arises, I feel like I can envision how things work internally.
					This has played well for me as a Mechanic and just an everyday fixer and maintainer of the things that surround us. Always having to
					have my hands dirty led to construction, woodworking, and now the curiosity of digging in to building and fixing code.</p>
					<img id="toolbox-img" alt="toolbox-image" src="img/toolbox.png"/>
					<h3>What do I do?</h3>
					<p>It comes natural for me to work on things. I come from a long line of "Shade tree mechanics". This, computer stuff, is a new venture
					for me to work on. I have in the past, been able to work and fix things without a manual. Coding has forced me to sit down and follow the rules. I am a fairly
					patient person and this has played well for me. I am not afraid to sit for a couple hours and figure out the issues with my code. 
					Along with being patient, I have been known to be an outside of the box thinker. All this being said, I feel coding will be a good fit for
					me at this phase of my life.
